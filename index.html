        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
Hello! I'm Gustave, currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Computer Science and Applications at Virginia Tech, with a concentration in AI and Data Analytics. My passion lies in transforming complex data into actionable insights, particularly within the realm of sports analytics.

My work integrates statistical modeling, machine learning, and predictive analytics to uncover patterns and drive data-informed decisions. I take pride in creating compelling visualizations that not only illustrate findings but also tell a story.

Within this portfolio, you'll find a selection of my recent projects that showcase my technical skills and reflect my enthusiasm for data science and its applications in sports. I'm eager to contribute to innovative teams where I can continue to grow and make meaningful impacts through data.        </p>
